            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="box">
                <p> Hi, I'm Muhzin, an IoT and ETL Solutions Engineer with a passion for building efficient data pipelines and solving real-world problems through technology. I specialize in designing and implementing real-time telemetry systems, and I've worked extensively with tools like Apache Kafka, Flink, and Grafana to manage complex data workflows.</p>

                <p>I hold a Master’s degree in IT Architecture and Engineering of IoT from IMT Atlantique, France, and a B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Cochin University of Science and Technology.</p>

<p>
Currently interning at Broadpeak, where I’m working on a real-time data ingestion pipeline for video streaming, I love collaborating with teams to solve technical challenges and continuously learning new things in this fast-evolving field. Whether it's improving data processing workflows or working on IoT-driven solutions, I enjoy taking on challenges that push the boundaries of what technology can do.
 </p>
 <p>
I’m now looking for new opportunities where I can apply my skills, learn from industry experts, and contribute to impactful projects. If you're looking for someone who’s passionate about IoT, data engineering, and creating innovative solutions, let’s connect!</p>
